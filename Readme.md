## Automation
A pseudo-working workflow engine.

## Setup & Description
### Setup
- I implemented the question in an interactive python script.
- It is run by executing main.py
```python
python -m main.py
```

### Description
From the introduction that was provided, I was able to formulate functions that I used to design the structure according to the working flow.
- I made assumptions that, Triggers, Actions & Conditions are constant.

#### Example
- I created a list of dummy automation names for the implementation of the example.
- An example of a user creating a custom Automation by choosing Opt-in as the trigger, with the action of sending emails to the subscribers on condition they are on a particular selected list. This ia achieved by selecting the "Is on list or segment" condition.
- For this example, the user can not use names 'Auto', 'Auto1' or 'Auto2' as they are already in used.
